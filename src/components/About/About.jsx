        <h1>Hello I am Jose Jimenez</h1>

        <p>I am a Web Developer with an Associatesâ€™s Degree in computer information science at Victor Valley College and a certificate in Web Development from the University of California Riverside. The certificate from the University of California, Riverside was from a 24-week boot camp where we learned the basics of HTML and CSS, to more advanced skills like react and building and hosting our own backend.</p> 

        <p>I am proficient in programming with HTML, CSS, and javascript which I used to connect both the frontend and backend of a website and Database. I have been programming for a few years now mainly focusing on the front-end. With my skill sets, I am able to build a single-page website with HTML and CSS or an infinite page website with React and Node.js.</p>

        <p>Currently, I mainly work with the React.js framework which is used to update and build powerful UI's. I have skills with Node.js so I am able to build a basic backend and connect the front and backend together. I have used many different API where I am able to get data and display it to show user info or give basic info on products or services. I have used different databases to store data or retrieve data. I mainly use MySQL, but I am also able to use MongoDB and Localstorage. I have used MySQL for more data-heavy projects and MongoDB for more lite projects that only need a small amount of storage. I also use Localstorage on a user's browser to store information like encrypted access codes or usernames and emails.</p>
