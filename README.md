# Profolio

## Description

A custom protfolio to give users information about me and few projects that are
listed. The projects have a description and images that show the page of the
project. The webpage uses react.js to build components that are resuable and
help build everything showen. React hooks were used to store information and
pass information through out the componenets. The webpage is responsive to
smaller screen and phone screens so people can get all the information no matter
what screen size. 

## Usage

The project is being host with firebase and can be found at
https://josejimenezportfolio.web.app/. Once at the website the user is able to
look at information on the diffrent sections like the projects, contact, and
about me. Users can view any project by clicking or pressing on the project and
they are able to see information on the porject with a popup. On the popup a
user can see the basic information of the projects and the way that they were
made and a link to their github page or if they have one, a live version link.
There is a contact section at the bottom of the page where a user is able to
send a message to me which will be sent to my personal email. There is also a
small notification system where if there are certain actions taken a small popup
will appear which can be exited out of by pressing it.
